# MealsToGo *In Progress*

I'm building this app as part of the Complete React Native Developer course from [Zero to Mastery Academy](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/), taught by [Andrei Neagoie](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/andrei-neagoie/) and [Mo Binni](https://zerotomastery.io/about/instructor/mo-binni/). 

MealsToGo is a restaurant recommendation app that allows you to:
* search for restaurants by city in a list view or map view,
* see the restaurant menu,
* order their special,
* create a favorite restaurants list, and
* update your profile picture.

### Tools & Skills Used for this Project
* React and React Native
* Expo, Android and iOS simulators
* Native navigation
* React Hooks
* styled-components
* Lottie for animations
* Deploy app to Google Play and the App Store
* Debugging & performance optimization

### APIs
* Firebase to store user information & manage authentication
* Stripe to process payments
* Google Cloud for maps and restaurant information

### Course in Progress
I'm still building (and at times re-building) this project to learn each topic at a fundamental level so that I have a deeper understanding of the how's and why's behind each skill or tool. I have already learned a great deal and am excited to present the final product soon!
