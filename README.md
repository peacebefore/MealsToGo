MealsToGo is an app that allows you to:
*search for restaurants by city in a list view or map view,
*see the restaurant menu,
*order their special,
*create a favorite restaurants list, and
\*update your profile picture.

It was built with Expo and styled components. The app integrates with Stripe, Firebase and Google Cloud for maps and restaurant information.

This project is part of a React Native course I'm taking from Zero to Mastery. After building the project according to the course guidelines (see my repos for React-Native-Project 1 and 2), I'm using this repo to modify the UI and design and build out more features for additional practice.
